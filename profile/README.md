Eclipse ThreadX is an embedded development suite including a small but powerful operating system that provides reliable, ultra-fast performance for resource-constrained devices.

In addition to the ThreadX, which is the kernel of RTOS, Eclipse ThreadX provides a set of system components to accelerate building embedded systems and IoT applications.
